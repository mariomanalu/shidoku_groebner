# This program solves a 4x4 version of the famous Sudoku puzzle called Shidoku using the Gr√∂bner bases
# How to use:
# 1. Store any "solvable" Shidoku board as a 1D array of length 16 with 0 representing the empty cells
# 2. Call solve_shidoku()
# 3. Print the answer in the form of 2D array

# We include eight tests for demonstration
# Tests:

# Test 1

#[[4, 0, 0, 0]
# [2, 1, 0, 0]
# [0, 4, 0, 2]
# [0, 0, 3, 4]]
